# KPP Patch

> [!CAUTION]
> Patching the KPP app can effectively brick your Kindle. Before you attempt
> it, you should have set up SSH in your Kindle, enabled it to run on boot, as
> well as double checked that you can SSH through the USB port during boot. If
> the patched KPP has an error, the app will fail to launch and the Kindle
> will just display a blank screen. Having SSH configured will enable you to
> restore the unpatched KPP app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Extracting and replacing the KPP app requires a jailbroken Kindle.

Since [5.14.2 (February 2022)][5.14.2 release] the Kindles run a new
homepage application made with React Native, replacing the older Java
application and UI.

This new homepage app, KPP (likely Kindle Plus Plus), makes use of the
[Hermes engine][], which means that if we want to patch or edit the app in any
way, we need to disassemble the Hermes bytecode, edit it, reassemble it, and
then replace the app in the target Kindle.

KPP Patch will take care of patching the KPP app, refusing to do so if
the file is not as expected, as sometimes different versions might break
patches.


## Extracting the file

The KPP app can be found in your Kindle under
`/app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc`. Copying it can be done with the system
mounted as read-only (the default), but replacing it will require mounting the
filesystem for read-write. It is recommended you set the filesystem back to
read-only after replacing the KPP app with the patched one.


## Usage

You can use `uv`, `pyenv`, or whatever other Python management tool you're
comfortable with to manage the dependencies. Here I'll just assume basic
`pip` usage. For copying the file from/to the Kindle I'll assume SSH:

```bash
# Install project dependencies
$ pip install .

# Copy the file from your Kindle, IP will likely vary
$ scp root@192.168.15.244:/app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc .

# Patch the app with selected patches
# The original file won't be modified, instead the patched file
# will have a .patched suffix
$ python main.py KPPMainApp.js.hbc

$ file KPPMainApp.js.hbc.patched
dump/KPPMainApp.js.hbc.patched: Hermes JavaScript bytecode, version 84
```

### Getting the patch back into the Kindle

Kindles have a read-only root system by default. You will need to
**temporarily** disable it. It is **highly recommended** that you re-enable
the read-only system afterwards. This can be done through the `mntroot rw`
(mount as read-write) and `mntroot ro` (mount as read-only) commands.

```sh
# Temporarily enable the read-write mode
$ ssh root@192.168.15.244
[root@kindle root]$ mntroot rw
[root@kindle root]$ exit

# Copy the patched file, without overwriting the original
$ scp KPPMainApp.js.hbc.patched root@192.168.15.244:/app/KPPMainApp/js/.

# Make the system use the patched file without overwriting the original
$ ssh root@192.168.15.244
[root@kindle root]$ mount --bind /app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc.patched /app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc

# RE-ENABLE READ-ONLY MODE NOW
[root@kindle root]$ mntroot ro

# Force a reload of the app, and check patches are working as expected
[root@kindle root]$ restart kppmainapp
[root@kindle root]$ exit
```

This approach will _temporarily_ "replace" the original file with our
patched file, until the next reboot. If the patches are not working as you
expect it, don't panic, you can simply reboot your Kindle and it will go back
to using the original file.

If you are certain the patches are working as expected, you can then make this
change permanent by replacing the original `KPPMainApp.js.hbc` file. You will
need to temporarily disable read-only mode again.

```sh
$ ssh root@192.168.15.244
[root@kindle root]$ mntroot rw

# Make a backup of the original KPPMainApp.js.hbc file
[root@kindle root]$ cp /app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc /app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc.bak
# Replace the original file
[root@kindle root]$ cp -f /app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc.patched /app/KPPMainApp/js/KPPMainApp.js.hbc

# RE-ENABLE READ-ONLY MODE NOW
[root@kindle root]$ mntroot ro
[root@kindle root]$ exit
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you get a white screen, or the patches don't seem to work as expected,
> you should restore the unpatched file. When reporting issues with a patch,

> **what you expected to happen**.

### Selecting patches

By default when you run KPP Patch, it will drop you in a `curses` window where
you can interactively select which patches you want to apply. By default no
patches are selected.

The original file won't be overwritten, and instead a file with the suffix
`.patched` will be created in the same directory as the input file.

If your environment doesn't support curses, or you prefer a purely CLI
interface, you can disable the curses TUI by passing `--no-interactive`. This
will allow you to select patches by passing `--patch_*` flags through the
command line. Run `--help` to get the most up-to-date list of existing
patches.

## Current CLI help

  --patch_collection_not_synced_popup
                        Patch out the not synced popup when adding sideloaded
                        content to collections. When adding sideloaded content
                        to collections, it will show a popup telling you that
                        the content is not synced. This patch removes that
                        popup. See docs/patch_collection_not_synced_popup.jpg
  --patch_homepage      Patch out homepage "Discover Books" carousels. Kindles

                        NOTE: Likely to work on newer devices and firmwares >=
                        5.16.3. Try `patch_homepage_sf` if this doesn't work.

  --patch_registration_detection
                        Patch out the Clould Not Available popup. This popup is
                        very common on unregistered devices. Newer
                        devices/firmwares require a registration to use, and
                        while jailbreaks allow us to bypass this, this popup
                        will always show when navigating to the home page. See
